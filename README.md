Create a 2 model MVC with comments and issues(cases) as the models.

1. please run bundle install and install simpleform
rails generate simple_form:install
2. please db:seed and db:migrate
3. The cases can be found at http://localhost:3000/issues
4. The comments can be created by follwing the case links.

I had to change the case keyword to issues following restriction of the word case.

I have created a simple app with Schema, routes, 2 controllers, 2 models and view pages.
